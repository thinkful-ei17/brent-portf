        <p>I'm a full-stack web developer from Gainesville, FL. I spent the last decade travelling the world playing drums and was fortunate
          enough to play festivals with Metallica, Korn and even Def Leppard. However, I was looking for a change and found
          a new passion in web development.
          <br>
          <br> 
          I believe that nothing in life thats worth something will come easy and that nothing which comes easy is worth anything.
          It sounds a bit cliche, I know, but hard work and an ability to quickly learn and adapt has got me this far.
          <br>
          <br>
          When I'm not learning a new programming language or technology you can find me reading about outerspace or playing drums!
